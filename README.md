*** Settings ***
Documentation     A test suite with a single test for retrieving a password.
...
...               The test loads a KeePass database named Database.kdbx using 
...               the keyfile Database.key. 
...               It then retrieves the first entry that matches the Username "User Name"
...               and logs the password from the returned KeePass database entry
Import            KeePassLibrary

*** Test Cases ***
Get KeePass Database Entry
    Get KeePass Database       Database.kdbx    keyfile=Database.key        
    ${entry}=	Get Entries By Username    User Name    first=True
